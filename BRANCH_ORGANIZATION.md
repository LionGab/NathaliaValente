   ```bash
   # Checkout PR #20 branch
   git checkout claude/auth-code-review-011CUKuWDq4KUGpJeFVVTRkv

   git add src/services/monitoring.service.ts
   git commit -m "Fix: Replace deprecated onFID with onINP"
   git push
   ```

3. **Merge This Branch** (copilot/fix-log-errors-and-organize-branches-another-one)
   - Contains fix documentation
   - Clean merge to main

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

4. **Review and Clean Copilot Branches**
   For each copilot/* branch:
   ```bash
   # Check if already merged
   git checkout main
   git branch --merged main
   
   # Delete merged branches
   git branch -d <branch-name>
   git push origin --delete <branch-name>
   ```

5. **Review and Clean Claude Branches**
   Similar process for claude/* branches that are no longer needed.

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)

6. **Establish Branch Naming Convention**
   - feature/* - New features
   - fix/* - Bug fixes
   - chore/* - Maintenance tasks
   - docs/* - Documentation
   
7. **Set Branch Cleanup Policy**
   - Delete branches after successful merge
   - Archive long-lived feature branches
   - Keep only active development branches

8. **Enable Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks (build/test)
   - Require branches to be up to date before merge

## Branch Cleanup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run this script to clean up merged branches

# Fetch latest from origin
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# List merged branches (excluding main)
echo "Merged branches that can be deleted:"
git branch -r --merged main | grep -v main | grep origin

# To delete a specific branch:
# git push origin --delete branch-name

echo ""
echo "Review the list above and delete branches that are no longer needed."
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly:** Review open PRs and stale branches
- **Monthly:** Run branch cleanup script
- **Quarterly:** Review branch protection rules

### Metrics to Track
- Number of active branches
- Average PR merge time
- Build success rate
- Number of stale branches (>30 days no activity)
