# Fix for PR #20 Build Error

## Problem
The build is failing with this error:
```
"onFID" is not exported by "node_modules/web-vitals/dist/web-vitals.js"
```

## Root Cause
PR #20 uses `onFID` from the `web-vitals` package, but `onFID` (First Input Delay) was deprecated in web-vitals v4.0+ and replaced with `onINP` (Interaction to Next Paint).

## Solution
Replace `onFID` with `onINP` in `src/services/monitoring.service.ts`

### Change Required:

**Line 6 - Old:**
```typescript
import { onCLS, onFID, onFCP, onLCP, onTTFB, type Metric } from 'web-vitals';
```

**Line 6 - New:**
```typescript
import { onCLS, onINP, onFCP, onLCP, onTTFB, type Metric } from 'web-vitals';
```

**Line 55 - Old:**
```typescript
  onFID(sendToAnalytics);
```

**Line 55 - New:**
```typescript
  onINP(sendToAnalytics);
```

### Additional Notes:

1. **onINP vs onFID**: 
   - FID (First Input Delay) measured only the first user interaction
   - INP (Interaction to Next Paint) measures all user interactions and is more comprehensive
   - INP is the recommended Core Web Vital as of 2024

2. **Update Comments** (Line 9):
   Change from:
   ```
   Tracks Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB
   ```
   To:
   ```
   Tracks Core Web Vitals: LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB
   ```

3. **Update Thresholds Function** (Line 83):
   Change from:
   ```typescript
   FID: { good: 100, poor: 300 }, // First Input Delay
   ```
   To:
   ```typescript
   INP: { good: 200, poor: 500 }, // Interaction to Next Paint
   ```

## Testing
After applying this fix:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Build should complete successfully.

## How to Apply This Fix to PR #20

### Option 1: Cherry-pick the fix commit (if you have access to the PR branch)
```bash
# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch origin

# Checkout the PR #20 branch
git checkout claude/auth-code-review-011CUKuWDq4KUGpJeFVVTRkv

# Cherry-pick the fix commit from pr-20 branch
git fetch origin
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-fix>

# Push the changes
git push origin claude/auth-code-review-011CUKuWDq4KUGpJeFVVTRkv
```

### Option 2: Manually apply the changes (recommended)
1. Open `src/services/monitoring.service.ts` in the PR #20 branch
2. Apply all the changes listed above in the "Change Required" section
3. Save the file
4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add src/services/monitoring.service.ts
   git commit -m "Fix: Replace deprecated onFID with onINP in web-vitals"
   git push
   ```

### Option 3: Close PR #20 and re-create from fixed code
If PR #20 has other issues or merge conflicts, consider:
1. Close PR #20
2. Create a new branch from main
3. Re-apply the changes with the fixed monitoring.service.ts

## Verification
The fix has been tested and confirmed to work:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ Web vitals monitoring works correctly with INP instead of FID
